# ga2017-homework2
Second homework for RPI Game Architecture 2017.

In this homework you will implement a vector math library. See
src/engine/math/ga_vec3f.h.

To determine if your implementation is functionally correct, the engine runs
some simple unit tests. See src/engine/math/ga_vec3f.tests.cpp.

For this homework you must correctly implement the stubbed out methods
in ga_vec3f (search for "TODO: Homework 2") and all unit tests must pass.
